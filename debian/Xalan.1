.SH NAME
Xalan \- Process XML documents with XSLT stylesheets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Xalan
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIsource stylesheet\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

Xalan-C++ (named after a rare musical instrument) implements the W3C
Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
and the XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0. XSLT is the first part
of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. It includes the XSL
Transformation vocabulary and XPath, a language for addressing parts
of XML documents. For links to background materials, discussion
groups, frequently asked questions, and tutorials on XSLT, see Getting
up to speed with XSLT.
.PP
You use the XSLT language to compose XSL stylesheets. An XSL
stylesheet contains instructions for transforming XML documents from
one document type to another document type (XML, HTML, or other). In
structural terms, an XSL stylesheet specifies the transformation of
one tree of nodes (the XML input) into another tree of nodes (the
output or transformation result).
